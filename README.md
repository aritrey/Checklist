# Checklist for routine jobs



This is a react native app for creating routine checklists, e.g. B. for a daily sports program or for shopping. The todos are saved in local memory. Each time the app is opened, the progress is reset to 0, so all fields are marked as not yet done and the routine can be started again.


### Features

- add and delete todos
- mark todos as completed
- restore todos after the restart of the app

### Getting started

1)  download the git repository;)
2)  run `yarn` or `npm i` and  `expo install react-redux redux expo-sqlite redux-thunk`
3)  run `npm start`
